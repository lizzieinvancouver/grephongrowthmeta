Data on tree growth 


Goal: go through all the Grephon articles (here: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/grephon/tree/main/articles) and use figures/tables/text from the paper to try to extract information that could help us compare values of growth across different studies. 

See data/grephongrowth_meta for info and check out issues on repo.
